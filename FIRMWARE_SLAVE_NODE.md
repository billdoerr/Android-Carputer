# Firmware
All notable changes to the nodes required for the Android application project will be documented in this file.


## [Unreleased]
### v1.x  (NOT STARTED)
- [ ]  Determine power usage with RaspberryPi + USBStick + two USB Cameras + router.
- [ ]  Setup RaspberryPi as Router.  https://www.instructables.com/id/Use-Raspberry-Pi-3-As-Router/
  - [ ]  IP Bridge.  **NOTE:**  Once enabling the bridge it no longer provices an IP address for a client connection.
##  Feature Creep - not assigned to any release
- [ ]  Android:  View images/videos archived on the RaspberryPi USBStick.
- [ ]  Android:  cron job to delete old snapshots.  Would also need new shared preferences and fragment added to SettingsActivity.
- [ ]  RaspberryPi:  Create REST API to obtain files (images, videos, data, etc).  Example using Python -> https://codeburst.io/this-is-how-easy-it-is-to-create-a-rest-api-8a25122ab1f3.
- [x]  Android:  Simple SSH connect with JSch to RaspberryPi. http://eridem.net/android-tip-021-ssh-execute-remote-commands-with-android
- [ ]  Android:  SSH Commands.  Create history of commands.  UI to also delete commands.  Expand list of 'stock' commands.

# Need delay
sleep 20

# Get date from master node and set date
sudo date -s "`ssh pi@192.168.4.1 'date'`" >> /tmp/timesync.log  

sudo chmod 755  /bin/timesync.sh

-------------------------------------------
2. PERFORM THE FOLLOWING ON THE SLAVE NODE

- [x]  Enable VNC.
- [x]  Install MotionEye.
- [x]  Setup RaspberryPi as Router.  https://www.instructables.com/id/Use-Raspberry-Pi-3-As-Router/
  - [x]  Access point.
- [x]  **Successfully deployed RaspberryPi as access point.**  Test and validate using RaspberryPi as router.  If this does not work out as planned then plan B would be to buy small router.
